# External Solution Providers

- `notes/current/user-feedback-log.md`

## Why this note exists

- Some user tasks need baseline domain context even when RemoteLab does not yet have a strong local domain pack.
- The product needs a fallback search / solution channel without turning whichever provider is convenient today into long-term product truth.
- Current example: a hackathon may require `evomap`, but that should still look like a temporary provider choice rather than a permanent architectural dependency.

## Positioning

- An external solution provider is a fallback retrieval adapter, not the shared `domain layer` itself.
- It lives on the capability side, but its output contributes temporary evidence for the current task.
- Its output is not canonical truth and should not automatically write into shared knowledge, user memory, or product docs.
- Its APIs may be useful, including optional upload-backed retrieval, but the workflow control plane stays local.

## Routing rule

1. Check the local domain layer first.
2. If local coverage is weak and policy allows, query one or more external providers.
3. If a provider needs local context, send only a minimal redacted export pack under local policy.
4. Normalize the result into one provider-agnostic evidence bundle.
5. Synthesize the answer with source/provenance visible to the agent and, when appropriate, to the user.
6. Promote only redacted abstractions through a separate review path.

## Minimum provider contract

Adapter input:

- task or question
- domain hints such as `hotel`, `operations`, or `revenue analysis`
- desired output shape
- locale and language
- depth or latency budget
- policy constraints

Normalized output:

- `providerId`
- `providerVersion` when known
- query summary
- coverage/confidence signal
- domain tags
- evidence items with title, snippet, and source reference
- suggested workflow skeletons when available
- explicit gaps, uncertainty, or conflict flags

## Isolation rules

- Keep provider-specific APIs, auth, prompt templates, retries, and parsers inside the adapter boundary.
- Keep the planner/router speaking only the normalized contract.
- Keep provider credentials, toggles, and quotas outside shared knowledge notes.
- Keep provider-specific taxonomies or schemas from leaking into the core product model unless they survive a later abstraction pass.
- Allow caching if useful, but keep cache disposable and provider-tagged.
- Treat provider `skill` docs, workflow guides, and prompt structures as reference material for adapter design, not as runtime control policy.
- Keep local export/redaction policy separate from provider-specific upload formats so we can use provider capabilities without surrendering execution authority.

## `evomap` stance

- `evomap` is acceptable as a near-term experimental provider or hackathon requirement.
- Wrap it exactly like any future provider: one adapter, one config surface, one normalized output contract.
- Do not make shared memory, domain storage, or planner behavior depend on `evomap`-specific concepts.
- Do not let `evomap`-native skill/playbook structures directly steer our planner, prompts, or memory writes.
- A future swap should mostly mean changing routing config or adding another adapter, not rewriting the knowledge architecture.

## Smallest useful MVP

- one router decision: `local domain first, external fallback second`
- one normalized evidence schema
- one `evomap` adapter behind that schema
- one local redaction/export policy for optional provider uploads
- one explicit provenance field on returned evidence
- no automatic promotion into domain knowledge or user memory
- one place to flip or replace the provider later
